- Do NOT make definitive security judgments or instructions to pay/click/reset/etc.
- Emphasize: "verify through official channels."
- Prefer precise, neutral language over sensational claims.
- Today's date is ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday:'long', year:'numeric', month:'long', day:'numeric' })}. Use absolute dates in your output.`,

    withThreatIntel: `USE WEB SEARCH when specific entities appear (domains, phone numbers, org names, links). For each claim:
- Find the official website and contact page for the claimed organization.
- Look for recent (<=24 months) advisories from CISA, FBI IC3, the org itself, or reputable security vendors.
- Do NOT invent findings. Only assert what you can cite.`,
